Develop a GUI application that performs the function of visualization of an oriented graph defined by the adjacency matrix represented in the form of a file, the structure of which is required to be developed. Fig.6 shows the layout of the application class diagram, which is required to be implemented in the application.
	The main function of the object of the class "Interface window" is to select the file that contains data about the oriented graph. When reading the file it is necessary to check the correctness of the data and in case of an error it is necessary to generate a corresponding message to the user.
	If the data are correct, an object of the "Oriented graph" class is created, links between the new object and the existing ones are established (if necessary), and then the graph is displayed in the corresponding window (object of the "Graph representation window" class). If another graph (another file) is selected in the interface, the old one must be replaced by a new one and redrawn.
