In the example for Assignment #7, a problem similar to the one in Assignment #6 is solved, with the addition that the vertices of the polygon are numbered, and one of them is designated as active.

This is implemented by creating a derived class for the polygon (inheritance relationship). In this class, an attribute for the active vertex is introduced along with a method to change it. The formal parameter of the method has a boolean type, indicating at least two strategies for traversing the vertices. In the example, these strategies are clockwise (true) and counterclockwise.

The canvas class is enhanced with a mouse button event handler. It analyzes which mouse button is pressed, right or left, and depending on this, the active vertex of the polygon is modified and redrawn.

In the application that needs to be implemented, the hierarchy TSample <- TDerivedSample corresponds to the hierarchy "graph" <- "event graph", where mouse clicks correspond to the generation of two events. The events, corresponding to your event graph, should be generated on your canvas, and in the interface where the canvas with the visual representation of the current state of the event graph is placed.
