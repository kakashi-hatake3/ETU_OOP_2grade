A DC electric circuit is assembled from switches K and bulbs L. The circuit structure must be described by some text string written to a text file with a default name (shema.txt), which must be loaded when the application is started. Syntactic parsing of the loaded string determines the parameters K and L and the circuit itself, which is displayed on the screen. The string from the file can be corrected, and at the user command "rebuild" check it for correctness and change the parameters and the scheme itself. It should also be possible to load a file into a file.
	By switching states with the mouse, change the states of the bulbs if they change.
